# python-client-benchmarks
Simple demonstration of benchmarking different HTTP client tools with a simple app. 

# What
A minimal python Flask app with no DB interaction returning constant content. 
Includes a docker build file and scripts to start it if you want to test that way.

# Why
So you can benchmark different clients... and possibly different platforms for running an application

# Using It
```shell
./build-docker.sh
./run-docker.sh
```

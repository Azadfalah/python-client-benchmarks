# Client commands
python benchmark.py --cycles 10000 --url http://172.31.22.99:8080 --benchmark-type size --output-file new-aws-results/aws-to-aws-nginx-http.csv | tee new-aws-results/aws-to-aws-nginx-http-log.txt

(and same, but https & port 4443)

Top reveals that during HTTPS tests, CPU runs ~50%+ for python process

# Server:
Start server:
sudo docker run --rm -i -t -w /tmp -p 4443:443 -p 8080:80 svanoort/client-flask-demo:2.0

vmstat 1 reveals that CPU is mostly in wait on I/O mode on the server, sometimes CPU goes as high as 40%
Saved results by: vmstat -t 10 | tee https-vmstat.txt

# TESTING CLIENT-LOOPBACK ON ITSELF
DONE WITH COMMIT HASH 7af6ad13ea2f32c84b6dd55456dff2eda35801af 
(this includes fix for urllib3 issues, and ended up commenting out urllib3 & urllib bits because crashy with verify errors)

In one terminal, start client:

sudo docker run --rm -i -t -w /tmp -p 4443:443 -p 8080:80 svanoort/client-flask-demo:2.0

In another terminal, benchmark it fully without HTTPS, using 1024B requests

python benchmark.py --cycles 10000 --url https://127.0.0.1:8080/length/1024 --output-file new-aws-results/aws-loopback-full-nginx-http.csv | tee new-aws-results/aws-loopback-full-nginx-http-log.txt

NOTE: in top, load average sometimes hits 2.0, python benchmark consistently hits 60%
